Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.


Problem statement -
An individual is emigrating to Singapore as an employee of an organisation/business/company.
Based on their preferences for commute time/distance, entertainment options(Theatres, Restaurants, etc) and others, where(which neighbourhood) would we recommend them to look for houses?

We will be leveraging the Foursquare location data for the city of Singapore for this report.

Target audience -
This report can be useful for anyone emigrating to Singapore for jobs/education, and will need to start house-hunting.
They will be able to use this report to look at the neighbourhoods of the city to understand the amenities they provide - movie theatres, restaurants, shopping, tourist attractions, public transport availability, etc. to make a well-informed decision as to which neighbourhood to stay in.
